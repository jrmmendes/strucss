# Strucss
Strucss is a simple CSS boilerplate generator.  At this moment, it only suports ITCSS.

# How to use

```bash
python3 strucss.py ITCSS 
```
or, make the script executable with
```bash
chomod +x strucss.py
```
and run
```
./strucss.py ITCSS
```

# Roadmap
I'm looking to include toml suport for the file structures, so the script itself will be generic.
